<h1>There is no War in C6 Space</h1><br><br>

<p>So... why are you here?</p>

<p>Well as long as you are... here are some funny looking charts.</p>

<li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11i7aE7hB7ES0Q-mtVmYRaO8dBj6DX7B6IL6GGNQQLP8/edit?usp=sharing">Spreadsheet</a>
<li> <a href="https://lynkfox.github.io/eve_battle_report_timeline/timeline.html">Timeline</a>
<li> <a href="https://lynkfox.github.io/eve_battle_report_timeline/totals.html">Totals per day/overall</a>

</ul>


<h2><i>Disclaimer:</i></h2>
<p>This is just zkill data. And manually gathered zkill data at that. And badly parsed by a "not a data scientist"</p>

<p>It is bound to have lots of mistakes. It is bound to be inaccurate. If you know who the Spreadsheet Guy is then feel free to sling corrections</p>

<p>I'll probably ignore you, cause you're probably drinking kool-aid or pushing your spin. But maybe I'll leave a note</p>

<p>Don't @ me bro.</p>

<p>I'm doing this cause i find it fun to gather info. Its a hobby. If you got a problem with that, well go touch grass</p>
